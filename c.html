    <h1>C Language Tutorial</h1>

    <p>C is a general-purpose programming language that is widely used for system programming, embedded systems, and software development. It was developed by Dennis Ritchie at AT&T Bell Labs in 1972. C is known for its efficiency, speed, and close-to-hardware programming capabilities.</p>

    <h2>Basic Example - "Hello, World!"</h2>
    <p>This is a simple "Hello, World!" program in C. It's the most basic program you'll write as a beginner.</p>

    <div class="code-container">
      
      #include <stdio.h><br>
      <br>
      int main() {<br>
      printf("Hello, World!\\n");<br>
      return 0;<br>
      }<br>
    </div>

    <p>Explanation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>#include <stdio.h></strong> - Includes the standard input/output header file for using functions like printf().</li>
      <li><strong>int main()</strong> - Defines the main function, the entry point of the program.</li>
      <li><strong>printf("Hello, World!");</strong> - Outputs the message "Hello, World!" to the console.</li>
      <li><strong>return 0;</strong> - Indicates successful completion of the program.</li>
    </ul>
